    "reasoning": "While the argument is logically valid (the conclusion follows from the premises via syllogistic reasoning), it is unsound because Premise 1 is factually false. Not all birds can fly - penguins, ostriches, kiwis, emus, and several other bird species are flightless. The argument demonstrates valid deductive form but reaches a false conclusion due to a false premise."

  "notes": "This example tests detection of unsound arguments due to false premises. The logical structure is valid (it's a valid syllogism), but the argument is unsound because the first premise is false. This is a classic example used in logic education to distinguish validity from soundness."
