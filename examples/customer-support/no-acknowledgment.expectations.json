  "notes": "This example demonstrates a customer support response that, while factually accurate, fails to meet quality standards. The customer expressed frustration about waiting over a week, but the response immediately jumps to order status without acknowledging their frustration, providing a greeting, or offering a closing. A better response would be: 'Hello! I'm sorry to hear you've been waiting so long for your order - I understand how frustrating that must be. Let me look into this for you. [order info] Is there anything else I can help you with?'"
